Welcome everybody, this is a personal web site whereupon I publish solutions for some of the CTF challenges and Virtual Machines I exploited. 

I also invite you to visit my blog, where I expose my red teaming experiments and present the tools I've been able to develop. Please keep in mind that the information I publish is for educational purposes only.
